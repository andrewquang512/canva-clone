This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) learning project cloned from[`Javascript Mastery`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahwoks_dawU&list=PLkVmW_lh_N92tfbqKqh9f6Wm5XGvOvOLv&index=9&t=3s) which i use as Next.js learning material. 

Javascript Mastery's original repository is here ["AI_SAAS_APP"
](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/ai_saas_app/blob/main/README.md)

In my copy version, I added comments with the tag // learn: to note some code that i will use as learning materials. In addition, I will add husky and commitlint packages with modified tsconfig and eslint config to enforce code style and follow conventions.

In the future time, i will try to migrate Clerk library and server-side logics into self-hosted backend server, also add and try some testing library
